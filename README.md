Reddit Daily Programmer Challenges

Welcome to [r/DailyProgrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)!

Dailyprogrammer is about challenging programmers of all skill level with weekly programming challenges. 3 challenges a week are posted at increasing difficulty. Solutions are peer reviewed and redditors can ask for the community for feedback and comments.

The typical posting of challenges occur on or near the following days.

Mon [Easy]
Wed [Intermediate]
Fri [Hard]
Challenges are developed from ideas posted on [/r/DailyProgrammer_ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyProgrammer_ideas) and ideas from the moderator team.

It is important to keep in mind a few basic considerations of the difficulty. The difficulty of a challenge is rated roughly for the required knowledge, theory and effort required to complete. There does not exist a simple or easy measure of rating challenges. What might seem [Hard] might turn out to be [Easy] for some redditors while some [Easy] might be [Hard] for other redditors.

Also note that the moderator team might not be able to post a challenge for an assigned day. This could be for many reasons. Although the moderator team strives to keep challenges posted as needed but if a challenge cannot or does not get posted, please consider looking or working on older challenges and continue to wait for the next challenge.
